It's a study project directed by Mr.Courtaud and I'm working on this existing project to make it more precise.

Essential development :
	- Update location with addition of geolocation,
	- Update nature,
	- Update resources needed,
	- Store all informations about events with JSON technology,
	- And any ideas you can propose to me.

I think there will be one commit for each end of essential development.

I'm in charge of this project, if you want contribute on the project or give some ideas, you can send me mail at julien.lacroix91070@gmail.com.
