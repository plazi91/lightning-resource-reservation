PROJECT DESCRIPTION :
It's a study project.
The goal of this existing project is to make events more accurate.

Essential development :
	- Update location; addition of geolocation,
	- Update type,
	- Update resources needed,
	- Use high level API to store all the new events informations,
	- And ideas you can propose to me.

I think there will be one commit for each end of essential development.

I'm in charge of this project, if you want contribute on the project or give some ideas, you can send me mail at julien.lacroix91070@gmail.com.

INSTALL :
To install this project in your Thunderbird Lightning extension :
	-	Verify Lighting is present in Thunderbird
	-	Download the extension from github,
	-	Move the extension into Thunderbird and install it,
	-	Reboot Thunderbird

PROJECT UTILISATION :
To see the effects of this extension, you need to create a new event.
The event dialog opens and you can see new items.
.You can switch between geolocation and name place with radio button.
	- If you check "Name place", you can write in the field name or choose from a list.
	This list is all name places written in your old events.
	- If you check geolocation, you can point your event location with a marker.
	/!\ : You must have an activ network to use geolocation.
.You can add an event type; you can write a new type or select one from a list.
	This list is all types written in your old events.
.When you select a type, it appears a new item on the window bottom called "Resources needed".
	- If you create new type, resources are empty. To add one, you have a button "+". 
	It creates a new resources key and its value which you can modify.
	- If you select existing type, resources are filled with already existing resources of this type which you can modify.
	Remark: By removing the key field, you will delete the resource too.
